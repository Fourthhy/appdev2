# Simple Book API with JWT authentication and MongoDB storage

This simple application shows the backend usability of this simple book api system
<ul>
    <li>This system has no data, meaning you'll build everything from the start, even your account!</li>
</ul>

So use the proper routes to handle the system functions

<i> localhost:3000/signup </i>

to sign up your account

<i> localhost:3000/signin </i>

to sign in with your account

After you have signed in, you may now have the access to different endpoints to view books.

<i> localhost:3000/api/books </i>
To get all the books, using GET method

<i> localhost:3000/api/books/:id </i>
to get a specific book, using GET method

<i> localhost:3000/api/books </i>

REMEMBER: The following endpoints shoud have "title" and "author" fields submitted with content to continue.

to post a new book, using POST method

<i> localhost:3000/api/books/:id </i>
to update a specific book, enter the new title and/or author content to update that specific book
