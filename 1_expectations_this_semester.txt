1. Introduction: Tell me a little about yourself. What programming languages or technologies do you know? Do you have any experience with backend development or Node.js ?

   • Over the past 2 and a half years, I have acquired and practiced different programming languages including Java, Python, C# and Javascript. Also gaining a foundational understanding and application using technologies such as React, MySQL, MongoDB, and Github. Despite those, I’m still far from filling the room of improvement and my goal is to continue expanding my knowledge and experience not just for my own benefit, but to better serve others.	

   •  In regards to backend development, I created a few projects that backend development was applied, one of those is my member-vouch-system (https://member-vouch-system.vercel.app/) using firebase and some projects that our dear instructor gave to us, and currently I have no experience of using node.js

2. Course Expectations:What do you want to achieve in this course? What specific skills do you hope to learn (e.g., building APIs, using Node.js and Express)? How do you think backend development will help you in your career or studies?

    • In my perspective, the elements of this course are perfect to the path I see myself in the developing world. I would not have to steal my free time to learn about the technologies under MERN stack because it will be provided to us. So I’m really expecting and pushing myself out of the limits to become a MERN stack developer. 

    • In this course, I want to learn about using and building my own API, using different technologies to manage databases and learn new possibilities a user may encounter in using an application, I also want to leverage of integrating AI into my projects not because that is the trend, but because I can see the weight of advantage it can do with the applications, and ultimately for the users. I also want to learn and refresh myself again in handling databases, as it is a favorite thing of mine to do through gaining, improving and refining the expertise to achieve my goal, God willing.

    • Backend Development will help me to gain more understanding and knowledge of how different applications, systems, websites etc. works, managed, maintained and kept secure especially with the different data and personal information it may contain. Not only that but to also improve my critical thinking skills into constructing logic and functions that will really upscale the current skills and enthusiasm I have.

3. Challenges and Areas for Improvement: Are there any topics that you find difficult or want to improve on (e.g., working with databases, building APIs, error handling)? How do you plan to overcome these challenges during the course?

    • Based on experience, I find difficulty in working with databases since if you are not careful enough, you may make changes to unintended areas or coverages. I can't tell what is difficult about building APIs since it is the first time I will be experiencing it.

    • But regardless of those challenges, the pursuit of knowledge is still present. I'll overcome it with more background research and project-based learning. That way, besides activities imposed by our instructor, I can see and test different uses of the things I learn. I can enhance my creativity and critical thinking skills to be a better developer than yesterday. For example, I'll watch a YouTube video or read documentation about our topic, learn something, and then implement it. I guess not everyone is like me, but they should find their learning method in order to improve.

4. Expectations from the Instructor: What do you expect from me as your instructor to help you succeed in this course? Are there any resources, teaching methods, or tools that would help you learn better (e.g., coding examples, tutorials, additional resources)?

    • I expect our instructor to be the best, as in our previous courses, always responsive to our questions and very friendly. I also appreciate the strict implementation of rules and policies, not only those set by the institution but also those that are imposed in the classroom to maintain orderliness.

    • For me, coding project examples are the best things we can have to learn things better. They give freedom to all students to create their own graded project or activity using the skills and knowledge they have gathered. That way, they are not limited to the objectives of the project but rather can expand it and make their projects in their own creative way. It will be best implemented as a group.

5. Final Thoughts: Anything else you'd like to add about your goals for the course or how you want to learn?

    • As above mentioned, my goal is to develop the skills I and my capstone groupmates need, to leverage the use of different technologies exists in our time.

    • Personally, I want a project or long activity where the goal is to create a project on our own, implementing the knowledge we gain in the course. It can be done individually or as a group, but the goal is to explore our own creativity and capabilities and to demonstrate our skills to others

//Side comment: I'm not saying the activities are not enough; I promise they are more than enough! I think this kind of personal project idea will help students explore possible projects that can be done using the skills we have gained. That way, sir, you can also learn a lot from us, and you can choose developers who can help assess and assist others in developing their own personal projects.
